## Benchmark Hypotheses

  * Will adding employees to the directory be the same for both implementations, or will one be faster
    than the other (and which one)?

<!-- TODO: state your hypothesis below and remove this line -->

  * Will finding employees by **name** in the directory be roughly the same for both implementations, or
    roughly will one be faster than the other (and which one)?

  * Will finding employees by **office** in the directory be roughly the same for both implementations,
    or roughly will one be faster than the other (and which one)?
